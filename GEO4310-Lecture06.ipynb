It is similar as $\\alpha$ but smaller, $\\alpha= 0.05$, this would be reported as '$p < 0.05$'. Reject the *null hypothesis* if the p-value is less than the *level of significance*. You will fail to reject the *null hypothesis* if the p-value is greater than or equal to the *level of significance*.

If your personal fixed level is greater than or equal to the P value, you would reject the *null hypothesis*. If your personal fixed level is less than to the P value, you would fail to reject the *null hypothesis*. For example, if a P value is $0.027$, the results are significant for all fixed levels greater than $0.027$ (such as $0.05$) and not significant for all fixed levels less than $0.027$ (such as $0.01$).
